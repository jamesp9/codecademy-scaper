# Codecademy Scaper

Save the html/css/javascript from your Codecademy session.

Run the program with the -f option.
For example
`$ ./cc_scrape.py -f Introduction\ to\ jQuery\ \|\ Codecademy.html`

This will create a directory for the course, project and checkpoints with `.html` `.css` and `.js` files.
